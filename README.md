# Summative Lab: Workout API Backend

## Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based backend API for a workout tracking application used by personal trainers. The API is responsible for:
- Creating, deleting, and viewing workouts.
- Creating, deleting, and viewing exercises.
- Adding an exercise to a workout (including reps / sets / duration data).

For this assessment, update actions are not required. You also do not need to support removing an exercise from a workout — only adding one.

The goal of this application is to demonstrate the ability to design and build a maintainable backend that:
- Defines models and relationships using SQLAlchemy.
- Enforces data integrity using table constraints, model validations, and schema validations.
- Serializes data and enforces request integrity using Marshmallow.
- Follows REST-style API patterns for common backend operations.

## Requirements Summary

### Data Integrity Requirements
Your API must include working examples of **all three** validation layers below. To earn full credit, you must have more than one working validation in each category:

1. **Table Constraints (database-level)**
   - Examples: `nullable=False`, `unique=True`, `CheckConstraint` to keep values in a valid range, etc.

2. **Model Validations (SQLAlchemy model-level)**
   - Custom Python validation using `@validates` to reject bad values before committing to the database.

3. **Schema Validations (Marshmallow-level)**
   - Marshmallow field and schema validators that prevent invalid incoming request data.

### Core Features
The API must support:
- Creating workouts
- Deleting workouts
- Viewing all workouts
- Viewing one workout (optionally including reps / sets / duration info per exercise)
- Creating exercises
- Deleting exercises
- Viewing all exercises
- Viewing one exercise (including which workouts use it)
- Adding an exercise to a workout (with reps / sets / duration)

No update/patch routes are required.

## Data Model

### Exercise
- `id` (integer, primary key)
- `name` (string)
- `category` (string)
- `equipment_needed` (boolean)

### Workout
- `id` (integer, primary key)
- `date` (date)
- `duration_minutes` (integer)
- `notes` (text)

### WorkoutExercise (Join Table)
- `id` (integer, primary key)
- `workout_id` (foreign key to Workout)
- `exercise_id` (foreign key to Exercise)
- `reps` (integer)
- `sets` (integer)
- `duration_seconds` (integer)

---

## Relationships

- A WorkoutExercise belongs to a Workout.
- A WorkoutExercise belongs to an Exercise.
- A Workout has many WorkoutExercises.
- An Exercise has many WorkoutExercises.
- A Workout has many Exercises through WorkoutExercises.
- An Exercise has many Workouts through WorkoutExercises.

These relationships must be represented in SQLAlchemy.

## Planned Routes (API Spec)

### Workouts
- `GET /workouts`  
  Return all workouts.
- `GET /workouts/<id>`  
  Return a single workout and its associated exercises.  
  Stretch goal: include reps / sets / duration info from the WorkoutExercise join records.
- `POST /workouts`  
  Create a new workout.
- `DELETE /workouts/<id>`  
  Delete a workout.  
  Stretch goal: also delete related WorkoutExercise rows.

### Exercises
- `GET /exercises`  
  Return all exercises.
- `GET /exercises/<id>`  
  Return a single exercise and the workouts it appears in.
- `POST /exercises`  
  Create a new exercise.
- `DELETE /exercises/<id>`  
  Delete an exercise.  
  Stretch goal: also delete related WorkoutExercise rows.

### Add Exercise to Workout
- `POST /workouts/<workout_id>/exercises/<exercise_id>/workout_exercises`  
  Add an exercise to a specific workout, including reps / sets / duration info for that pairing.

## Validation Expectations

You will be graded on having working examples of:
- **Table Constraints**  
  Example: non-null columns, unique constraints, positive-number `CheckConstraint`, etc.

- **Model Validations**  
  Example: using `@validates` in a model to ensure `duration_minutes` is greater than 0, or `name` is not an empty string.

- **Schema Validations**  
  Example: Marshmallow field validators that reject invalid request JSON before creating a record.

All three layers must be present to earn full credit.

## Git Workflow Plan

This project will be developed using feature branches and pull requests to maintain clean history. The plan is:

1. `task-1-problem-definition`  
   - Add problem definition, feature scope, validation categories (this README work).
2. `task-2-design`  
   - Document data model, relationships, and endpoint spec.
3. `task-3-setup`  
   - Confirm Flask app scaffold (`server/app.py`), `server/models.py`, `seed.py`, Pipenv, and project layout.
4. `task-3-models`  
   - Implement SQLAlchemy models for Workout, Exercise, WorkoutExercise.
5. `task-3-relationships`  
   - Add SQLAlchemy relationships between models.
6. `task-3-validations`  
   - Add table constraints and `@validates` model methods.
7. `task-3-migrations`  
   - Initialize Flask-Migrate, generate and apply migrations.
8. `task-3-seed`  
   - Build and verify `seed.py` with working sample data.
9. `task-3-endpoints-skeleton`  
   - Scaffold all required routes in `server/app.py`.
10. `task-3-schemas`  
    - Create Marshmallow schemas.
11. `task-3-schema-validations`  
    - Add Marshmallow validation logic.
12. `task-3-endpoints-logic`  
    - Implement full endpoint logic using schemas (serialize + deserialize).
13. `task-4-test-debug`  
    - Verify seed script, run manual endpoint tests, clean comments.
14. `task-5-readme-and-final`  
    - Finalize README, ensure main branch is up to date.

Following this branching process and merging into `main` will directly support the “Git Workflow & Management” and “Code Structure & Maintainability” rubric criteria.

## Next Steps

We are currently on `task-1-problem-definition`.  
After committing this README, we will open a pull request to merge it into `main`.  
Then we will proceed to `task-2-design` to formalize the data model and route contract in code comments before writing any database logic.
